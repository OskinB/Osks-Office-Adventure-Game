## 🌟 About the Project

I’m **Ósk,** a frontend developer who, while applying for a position at a game studio, got *a little bit* carried away.

Instead of sending a traditional cover letter, I decided to **make my cover letter into a 2D pixel game**. Since I’d never created a game before, I teamed up with [**Lovable.dev**](https://lovable.dev/) and their AI tools to see how far I could push my creativity (and patience).

The goal was simple:

- 🕹️ Create a working 2D game from scratch as a frontend dev
- 💡 Learn something new
- 🎨 Build something fun
- 🤖 See if AI can *actually* help with a real creative project and lay the groundwork

Spoiler: It did!

## 🕹️ The Game

You play as **Ósk**, who’s on her way to a company she dreams of joining. Explore the office, meet employees, go through a lighthearted “interview,” and discover who Ósk is, and what she has to offer.

It’s not a serious game but a *fun*, slightly silly, and personal interactive story meant to show a bit of my personality, creativity, and love for learning new things.
